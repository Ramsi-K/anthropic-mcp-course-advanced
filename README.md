## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several mini-projects:

### Notifications

Located in `notifications/`, this project demonstrates how to implement notification handling in MCP servers, allowing for real-time updates and progress reporting during tool execution.

### Sampling

Located in `sampling/`, this project shows how to implement efficient data sampling techniques with MCP, reducing the amount of data transferred between components and improving response times.

### Roots

Located in `roots/`, this project demonstrates file system access and management through MCP tools, including directory listing and file operations.

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Building MCP servers with FastMCP
- Implementing MCP clients
- Tool definition and registration
- Progress reporting and notifications
- Sampling for efficient data processing
- File system operations through MCP
- Error handling and logging

## Certificates

The `certificates/` folder contains PDF files of course completion certificates.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- FastMCP
- Anthropic Claude API
- Async/await patterns

## Learning Outcomes

Through these projects, I've gained experience with:

1. Designing and implementing MCP tools
2. Building secure and efficient MCP servers
3. Creating clients that interact with MCP servers
4. Working with the Claude API through MCP
5. Handling various data types and operations in MCP tools
